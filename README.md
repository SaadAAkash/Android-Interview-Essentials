# Android Basics

<details>
<summary><strong>What are the core 4 app components? What elements/tags do we use to declare them in the Manifest file?</strong></summary>
There are four different types of app components:

* Activities
* Services
* Broadcast receivers
* Content providers

To declare all app components, we use the following elements:

* `<activity>` elements for activities.
* `<service>` elements for services.
* `<receiver>` elements for broadcast receivers.
* `<provider>`elements for content providers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's Context?</strong></summary>
Context is the Interface to global information about an application environment
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's an Activity?</strong></summary>
An Activity is an application component that provides a screen, with which users can interact in order to do something
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's a Fragment? What's its relationship with Activity?</strong></summary>
A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity. A fragment has to live inside the activity. Fragments do not need to be declared in the manifest.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the use of Fragment?</strong></summary>
Fragments are used for its re-usability. For multi-pane layouts you have to use fragment that you can't achieve with activity. Use fragment only when you’re working with UI components or behavior that you’re going to use across multiple activities
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's a Service?</strong></summary>
A service is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations without needing to interact with the user and it works even if application is destroyed
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's an Intent? How many types of intent are in Android? Briefly explain their respective use cases.</strong></summary>

An Intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component.

Use Cases: Starting an Activity or a Service, Delivering a broadcast. 
* <b>Explicit intents</b> are used to start components in your own application. Use Case: You might start a new activity within your app in response to a user action, or start a service to download a file in the background.
* <b>Implicit intents</b> are most commonly used to communicate with components from other third party applications.  Use Case: If you want to show the user a location on a map, you can use an implicit intent to request that another capable app show a specified location on a map.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's a PendingIntent? How many types of intent are in Android? Briefly explain their respective use cases.</strong></summary>

A PendingIntent object is a wrapper around an Intent object. The primary purpose of a PendingIntent is to grant permission to a foreign application to use the contained Intent as if it were executed from your app's own process.

Use Cases: 
* Notification: Android system's NotificationManager executes the Intent
* App Widget: Home screen app executes the Intent
* A specified future time: Android system's AlarmManager executes the Intent

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the functionality of Intent filters? Point out a frequently-used scenario.</strong></summary>

This element is used in the Manifest file to declare the capabilities of an app component (i.e. an Activity) 

Use Case:
When we declare an Activity in the Manifest, we can include intent filters so it can respond to intents from other applications like the following:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application>
        <activity android:name="com.example.SendEmailActivity">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
                <data android:type="*/*" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</details>


# Android Specifics: Native

### Android Specifics: Kotlin

* [Main Reference Guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)
* [From Java to Kotlin](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/from-java-to-kotlin)
* [Kotlin Tutorial Series Playlist by Navir Reddy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7rooJFZhc3qPLwVROovGCfh)
* Declare a variable as nullable string (var_name?):

  ```
	var a: String = "abc"
	a = null // compilation error
	var b: String? = "abc"
	b = null // no error
	print(b)
  ```
 
* Safe call operator (?.)

  ```
	val a = "Kotlin"
	val b: String? = null
	println(b?.length)
	println(a?.length)

	output:
	null
	6 
   ```
* !! vs ? 

   ```
        +------------+--------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
        | a: String? |           a.length |           a?.length |           a!!.length |
        +------------+--------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
        |      "cat" | Compile time error |                   3 |                    3 |
        |       null | Compile time error |                null | NullPointerException |
        +------------+--------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
   ```
   
   !! is an option for NPE-lovers. ```a!!.length``` will return a non-null value of a.length or throw a NullPointerException if a is null. And ```a?.length``` returns a.length if a is not null, and null otherwise:

   ```
   val a: String? = null
   print(a!!.length) // >>> NPE: trying to get length of null
   ```

   ```
   val a: String? = null
   print(a?.length) // >>> null is printed in the console
   ```
   
* Ternary Operator: **Unlike Java, there is no ternary operator in kotlin. Use if-else instead**

* Bitwise Operator:

   ```
   val andResult  = a and b
   val orResult   = a or b
   val xorResult  = a xor b
   val rightShift = a shr 2
   val leftShift  = a shl 2
   ```

* Elvis Operator: The Smarter Type-Safe If

   ```
   val list = mutableList ?: mutableListOf() 
   ```
	is a shorter form of
   ```
   val list = if (mutableList != null) mutableList else mutableListOf()
   ```
   
   The name,howver, comes from the famous American singer Elvis Presley. His hairstyle resembles a Question Mark [Ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48253107/what-does-do-in-kotlin/48304523#48304523)
   
   ![alt text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVG64.png "Elvis Operator")

* when, if
   ```
	return if (x) foo() else bar()
	return when(x) {
	    0 -> "zero"
	    else -> "nonzero"
	}
    ```
    
     The above is preferable to:
     ```
	if (x)
	    return foo()
	else
	    return bar()

	when(x) {
	    0 -> return "zero"
	    else -> return "nonzero"
	}
     ```
     
* Functions

  ```
	fun double(x: Int): Int {
	    return 2 * x
	} 
	//SYNTAX: 
	fun funName( param : paramType ) : returnType
	{

	}
   ```

* Visibility Modifiers (public, protected, internal, private): public is used by default, means it will be visible everywhere.	If a declaration's private, it will only be visible inside the file containing the declaration.	If it's internal, it is visible everywhere in the same **module** (a module is a set of Kotlin files compiled together: IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle source set etc) and if protected, it's not available for top-level declarations.

 ```
 class EventViewModel internal constructor(
	)
	//internal makes class available to public, but constructor only to inside module
 ```

* Always declare local variables and properties as ```val``` rather than ```var``` if they are not modified (not variable) after initialization
* Prefer using immutable (whose state cannot be modified after it is created) data to mutable.
* Out Initialization code can be placed in initializer blocks, which are prefixed with the ```init``` keyword:

  ```
  class InitOrderDemo(name: String) {
	    val firstProperty = "First property: $name".also(::println)  //inits a val & also, prints the name
	    
	    init {
	        println("First initializer block that prints ${name}")
	        println("Second initializer block that prints ${name.length}")
	    }
	}
  ```
  
* Calling High Order Functions
  ``` 
	fun main() {
	//both of the ways are correct!
	    test( { println(it) } ) 
	    test(::println)
	}

	fun test(block: (String) -> Unit ) {
	    block("okay")
	}
  ```
* A sample input-output problem solving in kotlin example

  ```
  fun solve (clawPos: Int, boxes: Array<Int>, boxInClaw: Boolean): String {
  	return "okay"
  }
  fun main(args : Array<String>) {
    val input = Scanner(System.`in`)
    while (true) {
        val clawPos = input.nextInt()  //4
        val boxInClaw = input.nextInt() != 0 //0
        val stacks = input.nextInt()  //5
        val boxes = Array(stacks) { input.nextInt() } //1 4 1 2 3
        val outStream = System.out
        System.setOut(System.err)
        val action: String = solve(clawPos, boxes, boxInClaw)
        System.setOut(outStream)
        println(action)
    }
  }
  ```
* @Volatile before a field means that writes to this field are immediately made visible to other threads.
* Suppress Warnings: In Kotlin, there's no way to check the generic parameters at runtime in general case (like just checking the items of a ```List<T>``` or here in this ViewModelFactory, ```modelClass: Class<T>``` which is only a special case), so casting a generic type to another with different generic parameters will raise a warning, which needs to be suppressed

 ```
	 @Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
	 override fun <T : ViewModel?> create(modelClass: Class<T>) = EventViewModel(eventRepository, lifecycleOwner) as T
 ```
* Companion Objects: if you declare a companion object inside your class, you'll be able to call its members with the same syntax as calling static methods in Java/C#, using only the class name as a qualifier.

 ```
  companion object {
      @Volatile private var instance: EventRepository? = null

      fun getInstance(eventDao:EventDao) =
          instance ?: synchronized(this) {
              instance ?: EventRepository(eventDao).also { instance = it }
          }
  }
 ```

* Let’s say that we have nullable nameTextView. The following code will give us NPE if it is null:
	```
	nameTextView.setEnabled(true)
	```
  But Kotlin, actually, is good and it will not allow us to even do such a thing. It will force us to use ? or !! operator. If we use ? operator:
	```
	nameTextView?.setEnabled(true)
	```
  the line will be proceeded only if nameTextView is not a null. In another case, if we use !! operator:
	```
	nameTextView!!.setEnabled(true)
	```
  it will give us NPE if nameTextView is a null. It's just for adventurers!!!!
  
* Use Let:
	```
	sheetBehavior = BottomSheetBehavior.from(layoutMapBottomSheet!!)
	```
	Use let & use the it rather than the using !! & waiting to get an NPE
	```
	layoutMapBottomSheet?.let {
            sheetBehavior = BottomSheetBehavior.from(it)  //here, "it" is "layoutMapBottomSheet"
        }
	```

### Common App Architectures: MVVM

* ViewModel: While you're rotating the screen orientation or perform any changes in configruation, data may be lost (i.e. while filling up a google form activity & changing the rotation on device)
* ViewModel prevents memory leak, by hodling the data of UI.
* While fetching data from some API, some data can come after the initilization of the activity & its view.
* LiveData, an observer class, detects & changes the data in the UI if there's any change. LiveData is a data wrapper class, which is observable within a Lifecycle of Activity, Fragment, meaning that the observers are going to be notified only when the Activity or Fragment it’s active.
* When data is ready on the VM side, it’s time to wrap it in LiveData object using MutableLiveData
* Unlike the Presenter, VM is automatically retained on configuration changes with the help of ViewModelProviders, and finished only when Activity finishes or Fragment gets detached without saving state.
* If A is a LiveData instance and B is observing it, anytime A’s data changes, B is notified about this change and gets the latest value of A’s data.
* **Lifecycle awareness** : This means that a LiveData will only update observers (such as Activities, fragments or services) which are in an active lifecycle state and thus, avoiding NPE
* There is no reference to the View from a ViewModel so the communication between them must happen via a subscription. Hence, ViewModels expose events like openTaskEvent and views subscribe to them. 

* Process:

1.  Import androidx lifecycle components & initialize the viewmodel in an Activity:
	``` 
	import androidx.lifecycle.ViewModelProvider
	////
	lateinit var paymentViewModel : PaymentViewModel
	```
1.  Put viewmodel provider (which will get the viewmodel class) & observer (which will observe a MutableLiveData of viewmodel) inside the onCreate() of
	```
	paymentViewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(this, viewModelFactory).get(PaymentViewModel::class.java)
        paymentViewModel.paymentUrl.observe(this, Observer { paymentUrl ->
            loadBkashPaymentDialog(paymentUrl)
        })
	```

### Common App Architectures: MVI

# Android Advanced

* How does Thread communicate? - Threads communicate in 3 ways: ```wait()```, ```notify()```, ```notifyAll()```
* What's the access modifier of a method that no child class can extend/access/override: final
* Interface VS Abstract: Interface can have only abstract methods. Abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.  Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. Interface has only static and final variables.
* There's no need for access control modifiers: private & protected in OOP. How can we access any varialble, bypassing these access control modifiers in java? - Reflection
